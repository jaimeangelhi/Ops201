# Ops201
Ops 201 Course Repository

In this repo, Ops challenges showcasing different scripts and automations as well as Reading Notes help to display Ops201 content.

I'm learning these skills in Foundations of Computer Operations to gain further expertise in the realm of Cybersecurity.
Some fundamental concepts I learned in this course include protecting data integrity through backups and restoration, creating and establishing virtual machines and instances.
My favorite Ops Challenges have been those that utilize bash scripting.
The workplace can utilize these examples of shell scripting to automate and streamline their processes.  
The scripts that I would continue to improve if I had the time would be the Listing Array script that allows the user to search for a file or folder within the array and add the said file and folder to the array as needed.
I hope to improve all aspects of my shell scripting skillset, especially in the forms of bash scripting and powershell.
